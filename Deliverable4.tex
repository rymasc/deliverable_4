\begin{abstract}
 Developing on a batteryless device is made difficult due to an unstable power environment.
 Developers need to be keenly aware of how their code effects energy usage.
 In addition, developers need to be able to have an understanding of how their system will react in varying energy harvesting conditions.
 This paper details our proposal for an energy harvesting profiler system.
 This system will allow the user to attach a usb powered launchpad to a batteryless device in order to debug its energy usage.
 We focus on exploring task completion rate, flow completion rate and data expirations.
