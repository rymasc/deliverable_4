\begin{abstract}
 
 This paper details our proposal for an energy harvesting profiler system.
 This system will allow the user to attach different energy harvesting system front ends and batteryless devices.
 Once attached the system will be able to determine the lifetime of the system by determining the amount of harvested energy as well as the energy use of the system.
 Here lifetime means how long the system runs before running out of energy.
