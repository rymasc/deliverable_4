This section details our plan for completing this project. It details what parts will be done by the midterm and what the final deliverable will include.

\subsection{Completed Goals}

Designed and submitted a batteryless board for use with the MSP430 to OSHPark.
  - Include Figure with board image
Wrote Simple Sensor Code.
Wrote Simple Radio Code.
Wrote Simple MSP-MSP Direct Line Communication Code.
Using Simeon's more complicated UFOP Board in the interim.
Wrote Basic ANTLR Grammar for coordination Language.
Created Basic ANTLR Framework.


\subsection{In Progress Goals}

Assemble batteryless board when it comes in from OSHPark, should come in soon.

This model can then be used in combination with the ANTLR compiler to estimate energy usage by the batteryless system.

\subsection{Final Semester Goals}
The final goal of this project is to have multiple energy harvesting systems and applications built.
We plan on having a minimum of two harvesting systems - solar and vibration with two applications each.
We will build our battery based tool that can connect to an energy harvesting system and batteryless device to profile its performance.
The system will be evaluated by comparing the system estimated lifetime with the actual lifetime of the device in a programmable environment, similar to how it was done in Ekho.
