This section details our plan for completing this project. It details what parts will be done by the midterm and what the final deliverable will include.

\subsection{Midterm Goals}

There are two sets of goals for the midterms - goals related to the energy harvesting measurement and goals related to the system usage.
In terms of energy harvesting we plan on building basic energy harvesting batteryless devices, verifying they work and begin measuring them.
By time of the midterm we want to have a solar energy batteryless system working.
Then we can begin work on using a programmable environment to test the systems accuracy.

To start the energy usage compiler we will begin by looking into mayfly \cite{mayfly}.
Then we will start to measure the energy usage of each separate component.
By the time of the midterm, there should be a basic model for energy use for the MCU, sensor and radio.
This model can then be used in combination with the ANTLR compiler to estimate energy usage by the batteryless system.

\subsection{Final Semester Goals}
The final goal of this project is to have multiple energy harvesting systems and applications built.
We plan on having a minimum of two harvesting systems - solar and vibration with two applications each.
We will build our battery based tool that can connect to an energy harvesting system and batteryless device to profile its performance.
The system will be evaluated by comparing the system estimated lifetime with the actual lifetime of the device in a programmable environment, similar to how it was done in Ekho.
